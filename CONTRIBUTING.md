# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository. To ensure a smooth and collaborative environment, please follow these guidelines.

## Why these guidelines ?

Our goal is to create a healthy and inclusive space for contributions. Remember that open-source contribution is a collaborative effort, not a competition.

## Find an issue

If you're looking for a good issue to start contributing, simple issues fit for first time contributors will be labelled `good first issue`. More challenging issues might be labelled `help wanted`.

If you want to request features, improvements, or bug fixes, **search for existing issues first**. If you find a similar issue, comment and upvote the issue for visibility. If you cannot find a similar issues, open a new issue. If maintainer think the issue is an issue appropriate for contribution, we'll mark it as `help wanted`.

#### Bounty

The issues marked with the label `bounty🤑` offer rewards ranging from $10 to $100 upon successful closure.

⚠️ Please note that in order to be assigned an issue labeled with `bounty🤑`, you must have previously solved at least one issue labeled as `good first issue`, `level_1`, or `level_2` in this repository.

## Fork and clone

To contribute to the Blogx, you need to fork, clone, and run the website.

Start by [forking the repository](https://github.com/Safvan-tsy/blogx/fork), which makes a copy of the repo on your GitHub profile. This allows you to make code changes when you don't have permissions in the main repo.

Then, [clone the respository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository).

## Development

### Setup Procedure

- Docker

  OR

- Copy .env.example to .env
- Get a postgres db from https://neon.tech/ (or any other provider)
- Replace the DATABASE_URL in .env
- Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to setup schema

### Steps to run locally

With Docker

- `docker compose up`

Without Docker

- `npm install`
- `npm run db:seed` to seed the database
- `npm run dev`

Before commiting your code changes, make sure the website repo builds by running:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Submit a pull request 🚀

The branch naming convention is as follows

`TYPE-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

example:

```
doc-125-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide
```

When `TYPE` can be:

- **feat** - is a new feature
- **doc** - documentation only changes
- **cicd** - changes related to CI/CD system
- **fix** - a bug fix
- **refactor** - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

**All PRs must include a commit message with a description of the changes made!**

1. Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream to make sure your default branch is up to date.

```
$ git pull
```

2. Create a new branch from the default branch. For example `doc-125-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide`

```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

3. Work - commit - repeat ( be sure to be in your branch )
4. Push changes to GitHub

```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

6. Submit your changes for review. If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
7. Start a Pull Request (PR) by clicking on `Create pull request`. Make sure to update the PR description following the template provided.
8. Wait for a code review.
9. If you need to make changes based on feedback, make sure to re-request a review from your reviewer after you've made the necessary changes.

## General guidelines

- Work only on one issue at a time since it will provide an opportunity for others to contribute as well.

- Note that each open-source repository generally has its own guidelines, similar to these. Always read them before starting your contributions.
